1 Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
2 Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
3 Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
4 One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
5 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
6 One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
7 One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
8 In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
